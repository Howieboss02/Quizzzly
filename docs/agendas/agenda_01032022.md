# Questions for the TA
 - How do we divide coding work (other teams divided into tasks such as backend, frontend, design) but that seems to contradict to what the TA said
 - How are we supposed to change questions (in one game it asks for a year, the next one asks for 3 years) if the questions are hardcoded
 - When exactly will we receive the official backlog?

# Question round
