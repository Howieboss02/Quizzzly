## Meeting notes 15.02.2022

---

# Go through
    - Backlog
    - Code of Conduct
    - HCI Assignment

# Backlog
    - Too strict
    - Should do the "must haves", "should haves", "could haves" from perspective of the user
    - Should be suitable to present to client
    - Should not contain technicalities

# Code of conduct
    - Should be a set of rules
    - No need to strictly follow format
    - Say things like "We should strive to do ..."
    - No need to be very technical
    - We can create points of action ourselves (questions from us for us)

# HCI Assignment
    - Create a prototype to evaluate
    - Found team to work with

# TA Mentions
    - TOP PRIORITY: Everybody should have at least one merge request until Friday. Can branch from anywhere.
    - Use templates and milestones on GitLab
    - Relate issues on GitLab
    - Create issues from the backlog on the go
    - After we receive the backlog, we should add/change the issues
    - No specific date known yet for presenting, but only one date to present (not both). To be announced
    - Backlog should be more user-friendly
    - Extra feedback on the backlog if we finish by this Wednesday (evening probably)
    - Git assignment was fine for everyone
    - HCI deadline is 4th of March, while HCI Draft deadline is 25th of February
    - TA stressed that everyone should work equally
    - After next week we shall do stand-ups (not the funny kind) where we briefly (30-60 secs) present what we've been doing during the week
    - Familiarize ourselves with Spring ASAP.
