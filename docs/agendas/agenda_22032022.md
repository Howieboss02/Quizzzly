## Opening

## Approval of the agenda

## Points of action
- Everyone describes the work they did during the past (two) week/s
- Discuss how to better make sure that work is done by Sunday evening when we want to merge to main
- Discuss time management and dealing with merge requests
- Possibly change code of conduct to include regular checks of merge requests

## Action points for next week (Scrum board)
- Prioritize the tasks for the week and distribute them asap (Tuesday/Wednesday)
- Start working on the multiplayer mode of the game
- Finish Singleplayer mode this week (which ends on 29 march), so we can allocate time for multiplayer/improvements as well
- Reminder for Assignment 5A (individual) - Deadline: April 1st

## Any other business / questions

## Questions for the TA
- Should we try and focus on implementing fully functioning multiplayer or just try and improve the current app?
- If we do multiplayer, is it better to have something than nothing at all, or would it have to work pretty consistently and be advanced for it to be worth?
